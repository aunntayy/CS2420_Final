/******************************************************************************
 *
 *  The {@code FlightSymbolGraph} class represents an undirected graph, where the
 *  vertex names are strings representing airports. Edges are representative of 
 *  flights.
 *  By providing mappings between string vertex names and integers,
 *  it serves as a wrapper around the
 *  {@link Graph} data type, which assumes the vertex names are integers
 *  between 0 and <em>V</em> - 1.
 *  It also supports initializing a symbol graph from a file.
 *  <p>
 *  This implementation uses an {@link ST} to map from strings to integers,
 *  an array to map from integers to strings, and a {@link Graph} to store
 *  the underlying graph.
 *  For additional documentation, see <a href="https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/41graph">Section 4.1</a> of
 *  <i>Algorithms, 4th Edition</i> by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.
